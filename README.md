## Program Description

We compared the two languages from the syntactic differences to the level of applications. Despite two languages are very distinct, through implementing the selected design patterns and comparing these two languages side by side, we found that there are very similar and straight forward traits in terms of implementation of the abstract design patterns. In the presentation slides, we contained a very brief introduction in the beginning for the sake of those who are not very familiar with Ruby's syntax. The Object-Oriented design patterns we chose to compare are Singleton, Composite, and MVC. The first pattern is very simple and provides the audience with a straightforward comparison. The second one is intermediate and code is a little hard to read. The last pattern we compared by looking at the design of the frameworks that use this pattern. In the end, we conclude that the design patterns are a high-level abstraction that will not be affected by the nature of different languages.

## Notes on execution

### Ruby

##### Syntax part

Run the `tall-for.rb` with command `ruby tally-for.rb < xref.1`; 
Run the `tall-while.rb` with command `ruby tall-while.rb < xref.1`; 

##### Singleton part

Run the `logger.rb` with command `ruby logger.rb`

##### Composite part

Run the `composite.rb` with command `ruby composite.rb`

### Java

##### Singleton part

Simply run the main function in `Main` class.

##### Composite part

Run the main function in `CompositePatternDemo` class.
