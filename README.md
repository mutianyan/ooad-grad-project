Topic: OO Features between Java and Ruby

Team Members: Tianshu Pang, Mutian Yan

Program Description:
We compared the two languages from the syntactic differences to the level of applications. Despite two languages are very distinct, through implementing the selected design patterns and comparing these two languagae side by side, we found that there are very similar and staight foward in terms of implemention of the abstract design patterns. In the presentation slides, we contained a very brief introducation in the beginning for the sake of those who are not very familiar with Ruby's syntax. The Object Oriented design patterns we chose to compare are: Singleton, Composite, and MVC. The first one is very simple and provides audience with a striaghtforward comparsion. The second one is intermediate and code is a little hard to read. The last one we compared by looking at the design of the frameworks that use this pattern. In the end, we conclude that the design patterns are high level abstraction that will not be affected by the nature of different languages.
